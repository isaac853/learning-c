#include <stdio.h> //this is a header file library, i think they are like imports in python. this lets you run printf commantds


// everything goes into a function called main, 
int main() { 
  printf("Hello World!"); //every c statement ends with a ;
  int five = 5;
  
  five += 1;

  printf (five);

  // these end the function file thing as far as i cant tell, returning a zero means the file ran without error
  return 0;
}


// find out why this does not work
